const lectureTranscript = `Today's lecture covers key aspects of World War II, a conflict that reshaped the world order from 1939 to 1945. Let's begin with the causesâ€”namely, the Treaty of Versailles, the rise of fascist regimes, and the failure of appeasement. It's essential to understand how these elements set the stage for such a devastating war.
We'll also examine pivotal moments, including the evacuation of Dunkirk, which I'll highlight as a crucial turning point. As you study, remember to consider the resilience shown during the Dunkirk evacuation; it encapsulates the spirit of perseverance under extreme circumstances. 
Moving on, we'll look at the role of the Allies and the Axis powers, the significance of the D-Day invasion, and the Holocaust's impact on humanity. But don't forget the importance of leadership, from Churchill's steadfastness to Roosevelt's strategic vision.
Finally, a reminder: your exam is this Tuesday. While I can't officially say what will be on it, let's just say Dunkirk might feature prominently in the first question. Prepare thoroughly.
As always, my tone today has been a mix of urgency and encouragement. I hope that comes through and motivates you to approach your studies with dedication.`;
